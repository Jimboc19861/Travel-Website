				<p>Bruges is a wonderful city full of historical buildings, cobblestoned back streets, canals and parks and it's what
				most people visit it for.<br>
				<br>
				For first time visitors it can all be quite a lot to take in.<br>
				<br>
				If its a quick weekend city break or something a bit longer and whether you are in a couple or group or you are
				just flying solo, it's always handy to have some inside knowledge.<br>
				<br>
				So whether you're a first time visitor or a seasoned explorer, there are a few things you should know.<br>
				<br>
				But fear not, I have you covered. Below are a few points I have added to make your trip as pain free and
				enjoyable as possible.</p>

			<div class="tipstitle"><h2><u>Avoid The Crowds</u></h2></div>
			<p>Bruges is beautiful all year round. However, if you are not a fan of big crowds then winter is definitely the best time to visit.
			Early December through to the end of January are the quietest times in the city.<br>
			During winter, Bruges turns into a giant winter wonderland with hundreds of little markets and the buildings decorated in beautiful lights.
			The Market Square even hosts a giant ice skating rink in the middle!<br>
			while you may miss the full colour beauty of Minnewater during the summer, the city still hosts plenty of beauty although you might not
			want to book to close to Christmas and new year if crowds aren't your thing. But beware, temperatures can fall to near freezing so pack some warm clothes!</p>

			<div class="timetitle"><h2><u>Train Delays</u></h2></div>
			<p>Although most public transport in Bruges is clean, easy to use and reliable, the same cannot be said for the trains. While they are clean
			and easy to use, they aren't exactly reliable. It is quite common to experience 15-20 minute delays on journeys. The departure boards also
			only display trains leaving within the next 10-20 minutes so don't be alarmed if your train doesn't show when you get there.<br>
			So while there are many positives such as being able to bring your own food and drinks on board, handy for the long journeys, I would suggest
			allowing an extra bit of time to get to your destination.</p>

			<div class="holidaytitle"><h2><u>Public Holidays</u></h2></div>
			<p>Belgium has a lot of public holidays and you should take this into account when booking a trip. In total, there are 12 public holidays in Belgium
			with four of them falling in May alone and two in July.<br>
			During these days, most businesses, shops and public services are closed which means you could be stuck with things to do. You could save these
			days for things that are free to do and dont require the use of other services such as a walk along the canals or a nice picnic in the park.<br>
			It can also get quite busy around these dates, especially the ones in May that are for the religious holidays of Ascention Day and Whit Sunday and Monday
			so make sure to book accomodation early for these times.</p>

			<div class="relaxtitle"><h2><u>Relax, Not Rave</u></h2></div>
			<p>If you are looking to party all night and then spend the next day recovering and trying to forget the previous nights antics then Bruges isn't for you.<br>
			There are a distinct lack of clubs as the medieval town is more geared to restaurants and an abundance of bars for you to hop between
			and explore making for a much more laid back night out. That's not to say that you cannot have a good time as there are dozens of bars and over an eyewatering
			4000 beers to try!<br>
			There is a solitary nightclub and a couple of bars that stay open late but most bars close around midnight meaning you will always be in bed long before the sun
			comes up!<br>
			So if you prefer a quieter, more laid back experience then Bruges is definitely the place.</p>

			<div class="brugescardtitle"><h2><u>Get The Bruges Card</u></h2></div>
			<p>A great tip for visitors to the city is to get yourself the Discover Bruges discount card. This great little card can get you free entry to 27 different museums
			attractions in Bruges as well as 25% off a selection of theaters and concerts. It also gets you entry to some of the river boat tours and bike rentals around the city
			and the best part is that the card is given to you completely free when you check into most hotels! So check in, collect your card and go exploring for less!</p>
